# Smart Room Heater
This code provide ability to control Load - Electric Radiator (ER) with Solid State Relay SSR.
The application supports 2 modes of control:
1. Manual enable/disable the ER.
2. Automatic KEEP mode - will keep defined temperature in given range.
The application has many security checks, in order to protect the work with the heater,
while the user is sleeping or not at home. See **Security** section.

## Continuous Integration
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AndreyShamis/SmartRoomHeater.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AndreyShamis/SmartRoomHeater)

## Requirements
### Software
* **DallasTemperature** https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library
* **NTPClient** https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient
* **ESP8266Ping** https://github.com/dancol90/ESP8266Ping

### Scheme

https://easyeda.com/editor#id=ce48bbb9c10f4db7baa1a9dd215906da

#### Software installation
Put folders from downloaded archives under _/home/USER/Arduino/libraries/_

### Hardware
In Smart Heater project used:
* 2 * DS1822+   https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS1822.pdf  9-12bit  -55-125
* 1 * nodeMCU
* 1 * Solid state Relay FOTEK SSR-25 DA
* 1 * 220v to 5v USB PS
## Security:
1. On WiFi disconnect the load will be disabled(KEEP mode only)
2. Delay between disable to enable- default 60 seconds(KEEP mode only)
3. In case temperature value is anomalous the load will be disabled
4. Watch inside thermometer, the maximum inside temperature is MAX_POSSIBLE_TMP_INSIDE
5. Check Internet connectivity, if there is no ping to 8.8.8.8, load will be disabled
6. Add reconnect after X pings failures
7. Added \_FLAG_FORCE_TMP_CHECK, When true will cause to immediately check, used also when thermometer wire were troubled
